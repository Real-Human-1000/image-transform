Linear Image Transform
Applying linear algebra concepts to the generation of individual images.

This repo consists of a lot of work related to a YouTube video I produced, "Bad Apple!! But it's the Steamboat Willie Transform" (https://youtu.be/rlE_DZh57yY), where the music video Bad Apple!! was basically compressed using the frames of the animation Steamboat Willie.

This code is not designed to be easy paricularly to use. Sorry about that.
